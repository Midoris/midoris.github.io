								<p>The app was built from scratch by me and my teammate while I was working in QT Mobilit√§tsservice GmbH (Qixxit) in Berlin.</p>
								<ul style="text-align:left;">
										<li>Apple Pay</li>
										<li>Completely written in Swift</li>
										<li>VIPER architecture</li>
										<li>SocketServer</li>
										<li>RESTful API</li>

										<li>Google maps with custom drawings</li>
										<li>Push Notifications</li>
										<li>Firebase for storage and remote config</li>
										<li>Fabric and Circle CI for internal release</li>
									  </ul>
								
								<p>Our iOS app was featured multiple times by Apple and we were partners with Apple in launching Apple Pay in Germany. We also got invited to the closed Apple Developer Event in Berlin in 2018.<br /><br />
									The most challenging and interesting features I developed was the implementation of sorting and filtering of itineraries. <br /><br />
									The challenge was that we were using socket connection with backend for receiving results, meaning results were coming constantly throughout some time. Filtering and sorting must be done on the fly any time we got a new bunch of results and also any time user changes his filter and sorting options, which can happen while we are still receiving results.<br /><br />
									I used functional programming with ReactiveSwift to solve this problem. I made all filters and sorters to be properties that emit en event on change and subscribed them all to one listener that reacts with recalculation and UI update.<br /><br />
									Sorting and filtering was successfully implemented. With time the number of filters and sorters were increased, code was easily maintainable and understandable for other team members.<br />

									<p>My own app, live in App Store with a lot of reviews. The app has in-app purchases and brings me revenue every month. Everything is done by me: from screenshots and design to marketing using ASO with keywords.<br /><br />
										The idea of the app is to have a place to log all of your borrowings with your friends, so you never forget who owes to whom.</p>

											  <p>When I was on closed Apple Developer event I consulted with Apple experts about this app and gain a lot of insights, that I later used to improve user experience and UI.</p>

									<p>My own app, live in the App Store.<br /><br />
										The goal of Cortex app is to structure and organization your notes to make them easy to find. <br /><br />
										It uses a mixed organizational structure: Folders and Tags. So the note can be in a few folders simultaneously, which makes it very easy to find, and no structuring by hand needed.<br />

										  </ul>
										  <p>For tagging the notes Natural Language Understanding API from IBM Watson was used. I am using Concept, Entity, and Category to get the best tags options to the user.<br /><br />
											For an advanced search, NSLinguisticTagger is used with Lemma and Language schemes. Which means it will find the same word in a different forms, like say you have entered a word `walk` and it will find `walking` and `walked`. Also, it will find the same word in different languages.</p>

									<p>My own app, live in the App Store.<br /><br />
										The idea under the app is to help focus on the work required to get to your goals. So instead of thinking about your goal, you calculate how much time of work you need to put every day and every week and just focus on that. This is your process. Don't worry about the results, focus on doing the process over and over. If you keep on doing the process, you're going to eventually get the results.<br /><br />
										The app also has its counterpart on Apple Watch, including support for all complications.
